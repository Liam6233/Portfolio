# Portfolio
Work portfolio that contains work I have done that showcases my abilities and skills


Piece 1: Defense of Ra
- Built using Visual Studio's Monogame Extension, Defense of Ra is a 2D survival Game where the player takes control of an ancient egyptian warrior who defends the sun god Ra as he makes his way through the underworld
- The player and Ra must survive for 3 minutes with new enemies spawning at every minute.
- the player is armed with a spear that they can thrust at close range or throw to deal with far away enemies. They can also recall the spear similar to Thor's hammer.
- I programmed on the player class and its interactions with the spear, player collision, and overall project organization.

Piece 2: Last Stand
- Built in Unity, Last Stand is a 2D sidescrolling "Shootemup" style arcade game where the player must defend themselves from endless waves on enemy spacecraft.
- I worked on the entire game by myself while the art assets used were from other sources.
